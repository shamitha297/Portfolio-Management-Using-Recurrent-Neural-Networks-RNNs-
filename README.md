# Portfolio-Management-Using-Recurrent-Neural-Networks-RNNs-

Applied LSTMs to model stock price movements, leveraging deep learning to capture non-linear temporal dy- namics in financial data.

Compared LSTM predictions with a multi-layer feedforward neural network to gain insights into the impact of recurrent connections and memory cells on model performance.

Analyzed portfolio strategies, finding a trade-off between higher returns with increased volatility in LSTM-based predictions and more stable performance in equally and cap-weighted portfolios.
